## 🔍 HOW TO DEBUG NOW

### Step 1: Submit a Test Quote
1. Go to quote form
2. Fill out and submit
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Look for frontend logs

### Step 2: Check Supabase Edge Function Logs
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Edge Functions**
3. Click **unified-email**
4. Click **Logs** tab
5. Look for recent invocations (last 5 minutes)

### Step 3: Identify Where It Fails

**If you see:**
- ✅ Frontend logs but NO backend logs
  - **Issue:** Edge function not being invoked
  - **Check:** Supabase URL, API keys, network errors

- ✅ Backend logs up to "Calling Resend API" but error after
  - **Issue:** Resend API key invalid or domain not verified
  - **Check:** Resend API key in Supabase secrets

- ✅ Backend logs show "200 OK" from Resend
  - **Issue:** Email sent but not delivered (spam filter, wrong email)
  - **Check:** Resend dashboard for delivery status

## 🚨 COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: No Backend Logs at All
**Symptoms:** Frontend shows success but no edge function logs

**Possible Causes:**
- Edge function not deployed
- Wrong Supabase URL
- CORS issues

**Solution:**
```bash
# Redeploy edge function
supabase functions deploy unified-email

# Check deployment
supabase functions list
```

---

### Issue 2: "Configuration validation failed"
**Symptoms:** Error in edge function logs about missing secrets

**Solution:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Edge Functions → Secrets
3. Add/Update:
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` = `re_your_key_here`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` = `your_service_role_key`

---

### Issue 3: "Resend API error: Domain not verified"
**Symptoms:** Resend returns 400 error

**Solution:**
1. Go to Resend Dashboard
2. Add domain: `greenscapelux.com`
3. Add DNS records (provided by Resend)
4. Wait for verification (can take up to 48 hours)

**Temporary Workaround:**
- Use Resend's test domain
- Change `from` email to: `onboarding@resend.dev`

---

### Issue 4: Email Sent but Not Received
**Symptoms:** 200 OK from Resend but email not in inbox

**Check:**
1. Spam/Junk folder
2. Resend Dashboard → Emails → Check delivery status
3. Verify recipient email is correct: `admin.1@greenscapelux.com`
