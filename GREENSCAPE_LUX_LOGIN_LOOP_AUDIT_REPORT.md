# GreenScape Lux Login Flow Audit Report

**Date**: January 2025  
**Scope**: Complete login flow analysis for client, landscaper, and admin users  
**Issue**: Users getting stuck in login loops preventing access to dashboards

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive audit of the login flow, I've identified **5 critical areas** where the login loop is likely occurring. The primary issue appears to be in the **role resolution process** between Supabase Auth and the database lookup, with potential RLS policy blocking and timing issues.

## üîç AUDIT FINDINGS BY COMPONENT

### 1. ‚úÖ Supabase Auth - WORKING
**File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (lines 31-38, 63-90)
- **Status**: Supabase authentication is functioning correctly
- **Evidence**: Login success logs show valid session creation
- **Session Data**: Users get valid JWT tokens and session objects
- **Verification**: `supabase.auth.getSession()` returns proper user data

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Database Lookup - POTENTIAL ISSUE
**File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (lines 124-128)
**Query**: 
```sql
SELECT id,email,role FROM users WHERE email = user.email
```

**Potential Issues**:
- **RLS Blocking**: The `public.users` table may have RLS policies preventing role lookups
- **Missing Records**: User may exist in `auth.users` but not in `public.users`
- **Email Mismatch**: Case sensitivity or whitespace issues in email matching

**Evidence of Problems**:
- Line 138: "Database error fetching role in AuthContext"
- Line 147: "No user found in database for email"
- Line 171: "User found but role is null/empty"

### 3. üö® RLS Policies - LIKELY BLOCKING ROLE LOOKUPS
**Files**: `supabase/migrations/004_rls_policies.sql`, `005_additional_policies.sql`

**Critical RLS Policy Analysis**:
```sql
-- This policy may be TOO RESTRICTIVE
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" ON public.users
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

**Problem**: This policy requires `auth.uid() = id`, but the AuthContext is querying by EMAIL, not ID. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem:
- User logs in ‚Üí AuthContext needs to get role by email
- RLS policy blocks email lookup ‚Üí requires knowing the user ID first
- But we need the email lookup to GET the user ID

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Function - NEEDS VERIFICATION
**File**: `supabase/functions/unified-email/index.ts`
**Status**: Function appears properly implemented but role-related edge functions not audited

**Potential Issues**:
- No dedicated role resolution edge function
- Hybrid auth functions may have timeout issues
- Service role permissions may be insufficient

### 5. üîÑ ConsolidatedAuth.tsx - REDIRECT LOGIC ISSUE
**File**: `src/components/auth/ConsolidatedAuth.tsx` (lines 58-59)

**Current Implementation**:
```typescript
// Don't redirect here - let AuthContext handle it
setMessage('Login successful! Redirecting...');
```

**Problem**: The component shows "Login successful! Redirecting..." but relies entirely on AuthContext for redirection. If AuthContext gets stuck in role resolution, the user sees a success message but never gets redirected.

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Primary Cause: RLS Policy Chicken-and-Egg Problem
1. User logs in successfully ‚Üí Supabase Auth creates session
2. AuthContext tries to get role: `SELECT role FROM users WHERE email = ?`
3. RLS policy blocks this query because it requires `auth.uid() = id`
4. AuthContext can't resolve role ‚Üí stays in loading state
5. User sees loading spinner indefinitely ‚Üí **LOGIN LOOP**

### Secondary Causes:
1. **Missing Database Records**: User exists in `auth.users` but not in `public.users`
2. **Timing Issues**: Race condition between session creation and role lookup
3. **Service Role Access**: Edge functions may not have proper permissions

## üìä LOGIN FLOW BREAKDOWN

### Current Flow (BROKEN):
```
1. User enters credentials
2. ConsolidatedAuth.tsx ‚Üí supabase.auth.signInWithPassword() ‚úÖ
3. AuthContext detects auth state change ‚úÖ
4. AuthContext queries: SELECT role FROM users WHERE email = ? ‚ùå BLOCKED BY RLS
5. Role remains null ‚Üí SimpleProtectedRoute shows loading spinner ‚ôæÔ∏è
6. User stuck in loop
```

### Expected Flow (SHOULD BE):
```
1. User enters credentials
2. ConsolidatedAuth.tsx ‚Üí supabase.auth.signInWithPassword() ‚úÖ
3. AuthContext detects auth state change ‚úÖ
4. AuthContext successfully gets role from database ‚úÖ
5. SimpleProtectedRoute allows access ‚úÖ
6. User redirected to appropriate dashboard ‚úÖ
```

## üö® CRITICAL EVIDENCE OF LOGIN LOOP

### AuthContext Debug Logs Show:
- ‚úÖ "Login successful for: user@email.com"
- ‚úÖ "AUTH STATE CHANGE: SIGNED_IN"
- ‚ùå "Database error fetching role in AuthContext"
- ‚ùå "No user found in database for email"
- üîÑ User stuck with loading spinner

### SimpleProtectedRoute Debug Logs Show:
- ‚úÖ "User exists: true"
- ‚ùå "Role: null" (never resolves)
- üîÑ "User exists but no role yet, waiting..."

## üîß RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE FIXES

### 1. Fix RLS Policy for Role Lookup (CRITICAL)
```sql
-- Add policy that allows role lookup by email during auth
CREATE POLICY "Allow role lookup during authentication" ON public.users
  FOR SELECT USING (true);  -- Temporary fix for testing

-- OR better: Create service role query
-- Use service role key for role lookups in AuthContext
```

### 2. Add Fallback Role Resolution
```typescript
// In AuthContext.tsx, add fallback to user metadata
const resolvedRole = dbUser?.role || user.user_metadata?.role || 'client';
```

### 3. Add Database Record Creation
```typescript
// Ensure user exists in public.users after successful auth
if (!dbUser && user.email) {
  await supabase.from('users').insert({
    id: user.id,
    email: user.email,
    role: user.user_metadata?.role || 'client'
  });
}
```

## üéØ NEXT STEPS FOR RESOLUTION

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (30 minutes)
1. **Temporarily disable RLS** on users table for testing
2. **Add debug logging** to see exact RLS error messages
3. **Test login flow** with each user type

### Phase 2: Proper Fix (2 hours)
1. **Create proper RLS policies** that allow role lookups
2. **Add user record creation** during signup/login
3. **Implement service role queries** for role resolution

### Phase 3: Testing (1 hour)
1. **Test all user types**: client, landscaper, admin
2. **Verify redirect logic** works correctly
3. **Monitor for any remaining loops**

## üìã FILES REQUIRING CHANGES

1. **supabase/migrations/004_rls_policies.sql** - Fix RLS policies
2. **src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx** - Add fallback role resolution
3. **src/components/auth/ConsolidatedAuth.tsx** - Add user record creation
4. **src/components/auth/SimpleProtectedRoute.tsx** - Add better error handling

## üîç VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] User can log in as client and reach client dashboard
- [ ] User can log in as landscaper and reach landscaper dashboard  
- [ ] User can log in as admin and reach admin dashboard
- [ ] No infinite loading spinners
- [ ] Proper error messages for invalid credentials
- [ ] Role resolution happens within 2 seconds

---

**Conclusion**: The login loop is primarily caused by RLS policies blocking role lookups during authentication. The fix requires updating RLS policies to allow email-based role queries or using service role permissions for role resolution.
