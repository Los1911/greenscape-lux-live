# Automated Database Backup and Recovery System

## Overview
Comprehensive backup and recovery system for Supabase with automated scheduling, verification, and point-in-time recovery capabilities.

## System Components

### 1. Database Schema
- **backup_schedules**: Manages automated backup schedules with cron expressions
- **backup_jobs**: Tracks individual backup operations and their status
- **backup_metrics**: Stores performance metrics for backup operations
- **restore_operations**: Logs all database restore operations

### 2. Edge Functions
- **automated-backup-scheduler**: Handles backup creation, scheduling, and verification

### 3. Dashboard Components
- **BackupMonitoringDashboard**: Real-time monitoring of backup status and metrics
- **BackupRestoreManager**: Interface for initiating database restores

## Features

### Automated Scheduling
- **Daily Full Backups**: Complete database backup at 2 AM daily
- **Hourly Incremental**: Business hours incremental backups (9 AM - 5 PM, weekdays)
- **Weekly Schema**: Schema-only backups every Sunday
- **Monthly Archive**: Long-term storage backups on the 1st of each month

### Backup Types
1. **Full Backup**: Complete database dump including all data and schema
2. **Incremental Backup**: Only changes since last backup
3. **Schema Only**: Database structure without data

### Verification System
- Automatic integrity checks after backup completion
- File size validation
- Schema consistency verification
- Data consistency checks

### Recovery Options
1. **Full Restore**: Complete database restoration from backup
2. **Partial Restore**: Selective table/data restoration
3. **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Restore to specific timestamp

## Usage Instructions

### Monitoring Backups
1. Access Admin Dashboard → Backup Monitoring
2. View backup status, success rates, and storage usage
3. Monitor recent backup jobs and their verification status
4. Check backup schedules and their activity status

### Manual Backup Triggers
```javascript
// Trigger immediate backup
const response = await supabase.functions.invoke('automated-backup-scheduler', {
  body: { 
    action: 'create_backup', 
    scheduleId: 'schedule-uuid',
    backupType: 'full' 
  }
});
```

### Backup Verification
```javascript
// Verify existing backup
const response = await supabase.functions.invoke('automated-backup-scheduler', {
  body: { 
    action: 'verify_backup', 
    backupJobId: 'backup-job-uuid'
  }
});
```

### Database Restoration
1. Access Admin Dashboard → Backup Restore Manager
2. Select verified backup from available list
3. Choose restore type (full, partial, point-in-time)
4. For point-in-time recovery, specify target timestamp
5. Confirm restoration (irreversible operation)

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Backup operations require admin privileges
- Restore operations logged with user attribution
- Sensitive data handling in backup files

### Data Protection
- Encrypted backup storage
- Secure transfer protocols
- Access logging and audit trails

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics
- Backup success/failure rates
- Backup file sizes and storage usage
- Backup duration and performance
- Verification status and integrity checks

### Alert Conditions
- Backup failures exceeding threshold
- Storage space running low
- Verification failures
- Restore operation completions

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Tasks
1. **Weekly**: Review backup success rates and storage usage
2. **Monthly**: Test restore procedures with non-production data
3. **Quarterly**: Update retention policies and schedule optimization
4. **Annually**: Disaster recovery testing and documentation updates

### Troubleshooting
1. **Failed Backups**: Check error messages in backup_jobs table
2. **Storage Issues**: Monitor file sizes and implement cleanup
3. **Verification Failures**: Investigate data consistency issues
4. **Restore Problems**: Validate backup integrity before restoration

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Database connection URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Admin access key for backup operations
- `BACKUP_STORAGE_PATH`: Storage location for backup files

### Cron Schedule Format
```
┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0 - 6)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

### Default Schedules
- `0 2 * * *`: Daily at 2:00 AM
- `0 9-17 * * 1-5`: Hourly during business hours, weekdays only
- `0 3 * * 0`: Weekly on Sunday at 3:00 AM
- `0 1 1 * *`: Monthly on the 1st at 1:00 AM

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites
1. Supabase project with admin access
2. Edge functions deployment capability
3. Storage bucket for backup files
4. Monitoring and alerting system

### Deployment Steps
1. Deploy database schema using provided SQL
2. Deploy automated-backup-scheduler edge function
3. Configure backup schedules in database
4. Set up monitoring dashboards
5. Test backup and restore procedures
6. Configure alerting and notifications

### Post-Deployment Validation
1. Verify backup schedules are active
2. Trigger test backup and verify completion
3. Test restore procedure with non-production data
4. Confirm monitoring dashboards are functional
5. Validate alert notifications are working

## Best Practices

### Backup Strategy
- Implement 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite
- Regular testing of restore procedures
- Gradual retention policy (daily → weekly → monthly → yearly)
- Documentation of recovery procedures

### Performance Optimization
- Schedule backups during low-usage periods
- Use incremental backups for frequent operations
- Monitor backup duration and optimize as needed
- Implement parallel backup processing for large databases

### Security
- Encrypt backup files at rest and in transit
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security audits of backup procedures
- Secure disposal of expired backup files

## Support and Maintenance

### Monitoring Queries
```sql
-- Check recent backup status
SELECT * FROM backup_jobs 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Backup success rate
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage
FROM backup_jobs 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY status;

-- Storage usage by backup type
SELECT 
  backup_type,
  COUNT(*) as backup_count,
  SUM(file_size_bytes) as total_size_bytes,
  AVG(file_size_bytes) as avg_size_bytes
FROM backup_jobs 
WHERE status = 'completed'
GROUP BY backup_type;
```

### Cleanup Procedures
```sql
-- Remove expired backups based on retention policy
DELETE FROM backup_jobs 
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
AND backup_type = 'incremental';

-- Archive old restore operations
DELETE FROM restore_operations 
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
AND status IN ('completed', 'failed');
```

This automated backup system provides enterprise-grade data protection with comprehensive monitoring, verification, and recovery capabilities for production Supabase deployments.
