# Email Deliverability Debug Guide

## Issue: 200 Success but No Inbox Delivery

### Common Causes & Solutions

#### 1. Domain Authentication Issues
- **SPF Record**: Verify Resend's sending servers are authorized
- **DKIM**: Ensure DKIM signing is properly configured
- **DMARC**: Check DMARC policy isn't blocking emails

#### 2. Sender Configuration
- **From Address**: Must use authenticated domain
- **Reply-To**: Should be properly configured
- **Sender Name**: Avoid spam-trigger words

#### 3. Content & Spam Filtering
- **Subject Lines**: Avoid ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation
- **HTML/Text Ratio**: Include plain text versions
- **Links**: Avoid suspicious URLs or shorteners
- **Images**: Don't rely solely on images for content

#### 4. Recipient Provider Issues
- **Gmail**: Check Promotions/Spam folders
- **Outlook**: May have strict filtering
- **Corporate**: Often have additional security layers

#### 5. Resend-Specific Issues
- **Domain Verification**: Ensure domain is verified in Resend
