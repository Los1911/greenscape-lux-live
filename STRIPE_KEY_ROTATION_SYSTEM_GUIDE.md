# Stripe Key Rotation System - Implementation Guide

## üîê Overview

The automated Stripe key rotation system provides comprehensive security monitoring and automatic key rotation capabilities to protect against compromised API keys.

## üöÄ Features Implemented

### 1. **Automated Compromise Detection**
- **High Failure Rate Monitoring**: Detects unusual numbers of failed API requests
- **Geographic Anomaly Detection**: Identifies requests from unusual locations
- **Rate Limit Monitoring**: Tracks excessive rate limiting hits
- **IP Activity Analysis**: Monitors for suspicious IP address patterns

### 2. **Automatic Key Rotation**
- **Critical Incident Response**: Automatically rotates keys when critical threats detected
- **Manual Rotation**: Admin-triggered key rotation via dashboard
- **Stripe API Integration**: Creates new restricted API keys via Stripe's API
- **Environment Variable Updates**: Automatically updates keys across environments

### 3. **Comprehensive Monitoring Dashboard**
- **Real-time Security Status**: Live monitoring of key security
- **Alert Management**: View and resolve security alerts
- **Rotation History**: Complete audit trail of all key rotations
- **Performance Metrics**: Track monitoring effectiveness

### 4. **Notification System**
- **Admin Alerts**: Immediate notifications for security incidents
- **Rotation Notifications**: Alerts when keys are rotated
- **Detailed Reports**: Comprehensive incident reports with recommendations

## üìä Database Schema

### Tables Created:
```sql
-- Key rotation audit log
stripe_key_rotation_logs (
  id, event_type, old_key_hint, new_key_hint, 
  reason, environment, timestamp
)

-- API activity monitoring
stripe_api_logs (
  id, endpoint, method, status, ip_address, 
  ip_location, user_agent, response_time
)

-- Security alerts
stripe_compromise_alerts (
  id, alert_type, severity, details, 
  resolved, created_at, resolved_at
)
```

## üîß Configuration

### Monitoring Thresholds:
- **Failed Requests**: 100+ in 24 hours triggers high alert
- **Unique IPs**: 15+ different IPs triggers medium alert  
- **Rate Limits**: 10+ hits triggers medium alert
- **Geographic Spread**: 5+ countries triggers medium alert

### Auto-Rotation Triggers:
- **Critical Severity**: Immediate rotation
- **2+ High Severity**: Automatic rotation
- **Manual Override**: Admin can force rotation anytime

## üéØ Usage Instructions

### 1. **Access the Dashboard**
Navigate to Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Stripe Keys tab to view the security dashboard.

### 2. **Monitor Security Status**
- Green shield = Secure, no active threats
- Red shield = Active security alerts requiring attention

### 3. **Manual Key Rotation**
Click "Rotate Keys" button to immediately generate new keys and invalidate old ones.

### 4. **Resolve Alerts**
Click "Resolve" on individual alerts once investigated and addressed.

### 5. **Environment Updates**
After rotation, update these environment variables:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` 
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

## üîÑ Edge Functions

### `stripe-key-rotation-manager`
- **rotate_keys**: Generates new Stripe keys and logs rotation
- **check_compromise**: Analyzes recent activity for threats
- Integrates with Stripe API for key management
- Sends admin notifications for all security events

## üö® Security Features

### Key Protection:
- Keys are masked in logs (only first 8 + last 4 characters shown)
- Secure environment variable management
- Audit trail for all rotation events
- Rate limiting on rotation requests

### Threat Detection:
- Real-time monitoring every 5 minutes
- Machine learning-style anomaly detection
- Geographic and behavioral analysis
- Automated response to critical threats

## üìà Benefits

1. **Proactive Security**: Detect threats before they cause damage
2. **Automated Response**: Immediate key rotation for critical incidents  
3. **Complete Audit Trail**: Full history of all security events
4. **Zero Downtime**: Seamless key rotation without service interruption
5. **Admin Visibility**: Real-time dashboard for security monitoring

## üîß Maintenance

### Regular Tasks:
- Review security alerts weekly
- Monitor rotation frequency for unusual patterns
- Update monitoring thresholds based on usage patterns
- Test manual rotation process monthly

### Performance Optimization:
- Archive old logs after 90 days
- Monitor edge function performance
- Optimize database queries for large datasets
- Review and update threat detection algorithms

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Enhanced ML Detection**: Implement machine learning for better threat detection
2. **Integration Expansion**: Add monitoring for other payment processors
3. **Mobile Alerts**: Push notifications for critical security events
4. **Compliance Reporting**: Generate compliance reports for audits

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Live Keys Exposed**: The provided live keys should be regenerated immediately
- **Test First**: Always test key rotation in staging before production
- **Backup Plan**: Have manual key rotation procedures documented
- **Monitor Closely**: Watch for any issues after implementing the system

This system provides enterprise-grade security for your Stripe integration with automated threat detection and response capabilities.
