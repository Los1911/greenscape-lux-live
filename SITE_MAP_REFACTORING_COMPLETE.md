# GreenScape Lux Site Map Refactoring Complete

**Date**: September 27, 2025  
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Scope**: Routing and layout system refactoring  

## ðŸŽ¯ REFACTORING OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED

### âœ… 1. Quote Route Cleanup
- **BEFORE**: `/get-quote` used AppLayout with payment components
- **AFTER**: `/get-quote` uses AppLayoutClean with pure black Lux theme
- **Result**: Clean quote form without payment system interference

### âœ… 2. Payment System Separation
- **BEFORE**: Payment components mixed in AppLayout.tsx
- **AFTER**: Dedicated `/payments/*` routes with PaymentLayout
- **Routes Created**:
  - `/payments/overview` - ComprehensivePaymentSystem
  - `/payments/methods` - AdvancedPaymentMethodManager  
  - `/payments/subscriptions` - SubscriptionBillingSystem
  - `/payments/security` - Security & compliance info

### âœ… 3. Route Protection Applied
- **Chat Route**: Now protected with SimpleProtectedRoute (client role)
- **Payment Routes**: All protected with SimpleProtectedRoute (client role)
- **Admin Routes**: Maintained AdminProtectedRoute protection

### âœ… 4. Layout Consistency
- **Public Routes**: Use AppLayoutClean (black Lux theme)
- **Payment Routes**: Use PaymentLayout (dark dashboard theme)
- **Admin Routes**: Use existing Admin Layout (dark dashboard theme)
