# Stripe API Key Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue Analysis
You're getting "Invalid API Key provided: pk_live_***" error even though we updated the code with the correct key. This indicates the **environment variable is not being loaded properly in your deployment environment**.

## Root Cause
The issue is that while we updated the fallback key in `src/lib/stripe.ts`, your **deployment platform (Vercel/Netlify) still has the old/incorrect environment variable** set.

## Immediate Fix Required

### 1. Update Deployment Environment Variables
You need to update the environment variable in your deployment platform:

**For Vercel:**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Find `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
3. Update the value to: `pk_live_51S1Ht0K6kWkUsxtpuhNk69fjZuVrP85DNMYpexFeFMH5bCHdZjbtltPYXMcU5luEbz0SlB3ImUDAbifJspjtom0L00q27vIPCK`
4. Ensure it's set for "Production" environment
5. **Redeploy your application**

**For Netlify:**
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard → Your Site → Site Settings → Environment Variables
2. Find `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
3. Update the value to the correct key
4. **Redeploy your application**

### 2. Why This Happens
- Environment variables are set at **build time** for Vite apps
- The deployment platform caches the old environment variable
- Even though we updated the fallback in code, the deployment still uses the cached env var

### 3. Verification Steps
After redeploying:
1. Check the StripeKeyValidator component in your payment modal
2. It should show "Stripe key is valid and loaded successfully"
3. The environment should show "Live"

## Current Status
✅ Code updated with correct fallback key
❌ Deployment environment variable needs updating
❌ Application needs redeployment

## Next Steps
1. **Update environment variable in deployment platform**
2. **Redeploy application**
3. **Test payment methods modal**
4. **Verify StripeKeyValidator shows success**
