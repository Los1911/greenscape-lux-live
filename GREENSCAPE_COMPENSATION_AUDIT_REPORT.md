# GreenScape Lux Compensation System Audit Report

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
**CRITICAL FINDING**: GreenScape Lux currently operates as a **FLAT PASSTHROUGH** system with NO tiered percentage deductions implemented.

## AUDIT FINDINGS

### 1. MISSING COMPONENTS
The requested audit components **DO NOT EXIST**:
- ❌ EarningsBreakdownTable.tsx - NOT FOUND
- ❌ LiveEarningsBreakdown.tsx - NOT FOUND  
- ❌ PlatformRevenueOverview.tsx - NOT FOUND

### 2. EXISTING PAYMENT LOGIC ANALYSIS

#### Stripe Payment Flow:
**File**: `create-payment-intent` Edge Function
- ✅ Creates payment intents with full job amount
- ❌ **NO percentage deduction applied**
- ❌ **NO tiered logic implemented**

**Current Flow**: Client pays $100 → Landscaper receives ~$97 (minus Stripe fees only)

#### Earnings Display Components:
**File**: `src/components/shared/EarningsCard.tsx` (Lines 146-148)
```typescript
const landscaperPayout = earnings.totalEarnings * (earnings.payoutPercentage / 100);
const platformFee = 100 - earnings.payoutPercentage;
```
- ✅ Has percentage calculation framework
- ❌ **payoutPercentage is hardcoded/static**
- ❌ **NO tiered 10%-25% logic**

### 3. STRIPE FEE HANDLING
**Current Implementation**: Stripe fees (~2.9% + $0.30) are absorbed by landscaper
**Files Affected**: 
- `stripe-webhook` Edge Function
- `create-payment-intent` Edge Function

### 4. DATABASE SCHEMA ANALYSIS
**Payments Table**: Stores full amounts without platform deductions
**Jobs Table**: No commission/percentage fields found

## CRITICAL GAPS

### ❌ MISSING: Tiered Percentage Logic
- No 10%-25% GreenScape percentage implementation
- No volume-based tier calculations
- No dynamic commission structure

### ❌ MISSING: Platform Revenue Tracking
- Platform earnings not separated from landscaper payouts
- No commission tracking in database
- No revenue analytics for platform

### ❌ MISSING: Payout Calculation Engine
- No backend logic for percentage deductions
- No tier evaluation system
- No automated commission calculations

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
1. **Implement Tier Logic** in payment processing
2. **Add Commission Fields** to database schema
3. **Create Platform Revenue Tracking** system
4. **Update Payout Calculations** to include GreenScape percentages

### ESTIMATED IMPACT:
- **Current**: $100 job = $97 to landscaper (3% Stripe fee only)
- **With 15% GreenScape Fee**: $100 job = $82 to landscaper (15% platform + 3% Stripe)

## CONCLUSION
**GreenScape Lux is currently operating at 0% platform commission.** All revenue goes to landscapers minus Stripe processing fees. The tiered 10%-25% commission structure exists only in concept, not in code.
