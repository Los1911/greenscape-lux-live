# Unified Email Consolidation - COMPLETE ✅

## Problem Solved
Fixed quote confirmation emails and password reset flow to use unified-email → Resend pipeline for proper tracking and delivery.

## Changes Made

### 1. Quote Flow Consolidation ✅
**Updated ClientQuoteForm.tsx (lines 97-167):**
- Changed from `sendQuoteEmail` function to `unified-email` function
- Added comprehensive data mapping for compatibility
- Enhanced logging for debugging
- Maintained database fallback for reliability

**Updated GetQuoteEnhanced.tsx (lines 180-206):**
- Changed from direct Resend calls to `unified-email` function
- Added proper data field mapping
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 2. Password Reset Unification ✅
**Already Using Unified Flow:**
- ForgotPassword.tsx uses `handleUnifiedPasswordReset()`
- ForgotPasswordInline.tsx uses unified handler
- password-reset-with-unified-email function routes through Resend

### 3. Contact Forms ✅
**Already Using Unified Flow:**
- CTASection.tsx uses `unified-email` function
- All contact forms route through Resend pipeline

## Email Flow Architecture
```
Quote Requests → unified-email → Resend API → Email Delivery → email_logs table
Password Reset → password-reset-with-unified-email → unified-email → Resend API
Contact Forms → unified-email → Resend API → Email Delivery → email_logs table
```

## Benefits Achieved
