# GreenScape Lux Production Readiness Audit 2025 - Updated

## üéØ Executive Summary
**Current Production Readiness Score: 78/100**

### Critical Issues Identified:

- ‚úÖ Google Maps API key present and functional
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Stripe publishable key configured but using live key
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: Stripe secret key using placeholder
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: Stripe webhook secret using placeholder
- ‚ùå Resend API key using placeholder

### 2. Payment System Integration (12/20)
- ‚úÖ Stripe Elements properly integrated
- ‚úÖ Payment forms functional with test keys
- ‚úÖ Subscription management system implemented
- ‚úÖ Commission calculation system in place
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: Backend payment processing disabled (no live secret key)
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: Webhook processing non-functional
- ‚ùå End-to-end payment flow not verified with live keys

### 3. Security & Authentication (18/20)
- ‚úÖ Supabase RLS policies implemented
- ‚úÖ User authentication working properly
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control functional
- ‚úÖ Environment variables properly secured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some debug logging still present in production code

### 4. Mobile Responsiveness (14/20)
- ‚úÖ Main application responsive
- ‚úÖ Dashboard components mobile-friendly
- ‚úÖ Form layouts adapt to mobile screens
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Payment checkout flows need mobile verification
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Google Maps components need mobile testing

### 5. Code Quality & Performance (19/20)
- ‚úÖ Modern React architecture
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling implemented
- ‚úÖ Loading states and user feedback
- ‚úÖ Optimized image handling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some console.log statements in production code

## üö® Critical Actions Required

### 1. Configure Live Stripe Keys (URGENT)
```bash
# Add to Vercel environment variables:
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_[YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY]
VITE_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_[YOUR_ACTUAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET]
```

**Impact**: Without these, payments will fail in production.

### 2. Set Up Stripe Webhooks (URGENT)
1. Create webhook endpoint in Stripe dashboard
2. Configure required events (payment_intent.succeeded, etc.)
3. Copy webhook secret to environment variables

**Impact**: Without webhooks, payment status won't update automatically.

### 3. Configure Resend Email Service (HIGH)
```bash
# Add to Vercel environment variables:
VITE_RESEND_API_KEY=re_[YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY]
```

**Impact**: Email notifications won't work (quotes, confirmations, etc.)
