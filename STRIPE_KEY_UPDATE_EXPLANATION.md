# Stripe API Key Error Explanation

## Why You Were Getting "Invalid API Key" Error

### Root Cause
You were getting the "Invalid API Key provided: pk_live_***" error because your application was using an **incorrect or outdated** Stripe publishable key in the codebase.

### What Was Wrong
1. **Hardcoded Fallback Key**: The `src/lib/stripe.ts` file had a hardcoded fallback key that was different from your actual Stripe key
2. **Environment Variable Mismatch**: The environment template had the wrong key value
3. **Key Validation**: Stripe was rejecting the old key because it wasn't valid for your account

### Technical Details
- **Old Key**: `pk_live_51S1Ht0K6kWkUsxtpyGP3sA3D3F15hFYBvYRoO65PzWD8qeZIx9ucf6S3wAGthJjZMlaBYTXGinrA5cCAGL4Soz00DoQWMmBu`
- **Your Correct Key**: `pk_live_51S1Ht0K6kWkUsxtpuhNk69fjZuVrP85DNMYpexFeFMH5bCHdZjbtltPYXMcU5luEbz0SlB3ImUDAbifJspjtom0L00q27vIPCK`

### Files Updated
1. **src/lib/stripe.ts** - Updated fallback publishable key
2. **.env.local.template** - Updated environment template

### Next Steps
1. **Update Vercel Environment Variables**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Update `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` with your correct key
   - Redeploy the application

2. **Local Development**:
   - Create a `.env.local` file with your correct key
   - Restart your development server

### Why This Happens
- Stripe keys are account-specific and project-specific
- Each Stripe account has unique keys
- Using someone else's key or an old key will result in authentication errors
- The application needs to use YOUR specific Stripe keys for YOUR account

The payment system should now work correctly with your valid Stripe publishable key!
