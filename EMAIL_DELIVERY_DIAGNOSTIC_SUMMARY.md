## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE

### The Receiving Domain Is Not Configured

**greenscapelux.com needs TWO types of email configuration:**

1. **SENDING Domain** (noreply@greenscapelux.com)

   - Purpose: Allows Resend to send emails on your behalf

2. **RECEIVING Domain** (admin.1@greenscapelux.com)
   - Status: ‚ùå NOT CONFIGURED
   - Purpose: Allows the mailbox to receive emails
   - **This is the problem!**

## üõ†Ô∏è DNS CONFIGURATION GUIDE

### Step 1: Add MX Records (Email Reception)

**For Email Forwarding:**
```dns
Type: MX
Name: @
Priority: 10
Value: mx.forwardemail.net
TTL: 3600
```

**For Google Workspace:**
```dns
Type: MX | Name: @ | Priority: 1 | Value: ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM
Type: MX | Name: @ | Priority: 5 | Value: ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM
Type: MX | Name: @ | Priority: 5 | Value: ALT2.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM
```

### Step 2: Verify Resend Domain (Email Sending)

1. Login: https://resend.com/domains
2. Add domain: greenscapelux.com
3. Copy DNS records provided
4. Add to your DNS:
   ```dns
   Type: TXT | Name: @ | Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
   Type: TXT | Name: resend._domainkey | Value: [From Resend]
   Type: TXT | Name: _dmarc | Value: v=DMARC1; p=none
   ```

### Step 3: Wait for DNS Propagation
- Typical time: 5-30 minutes
- Maximum time: 24-48 hours

### Step 4: Test Email Delivery

```bash
# Test via Resend API
curl -X POST https://api.resend.com/emails \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RESEND_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "noreply@greenscapelux.com",
    "to": "admin.1@greenscapelux.com",
    "subject": "Test Email",
    "html": "<p>Testing DNS configuration</p>"
