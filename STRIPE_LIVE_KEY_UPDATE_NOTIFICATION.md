# üö® CRITICAL: Manual Action Required for Stripe Live Keys

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Code fixes applied to remove hardcoded fallback keys
- ‚úÖ StripeEnvironmentValidator component created for diagnostics
- ‚ùå **VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY still missing in Vercel production**

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### You Must Manually Complete These Steps:

#### 1. Set Vercel Environment Variable
```
Variable Name: VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
Variable Value: pk_live_YOUR_ACTUAL_LIVE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
Environment: Production
```

#### 2. Access Vercel Dashboard
- Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Select your GreenScape Lux project
- Navigate to: Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Add the missing variable
- Save changes

#### 3. Trigger Redeployment
```bash
# Option A: Git push to trigger auto-deploy
git add .
git commit -m "Trigger redeploy for Stripe key update"
git push origin main

# Option B: Manual redeploy in Vercel dashboard
```

#### 4. Verify Fix
After deployment:
- Visit your admin dashboard
- Check StripeEnvironmentValidator component
- Confirm live key is detected
- Test adding payment method

## Why This Manual Step is Required
- I cannot directly access your Vercel account
- Environment variables require secure manual configuration
- Live API keys should never be committed to code

## Expected Timeline
- Setup: 2-3 minutes
- Deployment: 1-2 minutes  
- Verification: 1 minute
- **Total: ~5 minutes to resolve**

## Verification Script
After deployment, run:
```bash
node scripts/vercel-env-deployment.js
```

This will confirm all environment variables are properly configured.
