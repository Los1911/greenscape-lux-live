# ✅ Vercel Detachment Complete

## Removed GitHub Actions Workflows

The following Vercel-related GitHub Actions workflows have been deleted to complete the migration to Famous:

1. ✅ `.github/workflows/vercel-auto-deployment.yml` - DELETED
2. ✅ `.github/workflows/vercel-deployment-automation.yml` - DELETED
3. ✅ `.github/workflows/main-branch-auto-deploy.yml` - DELETED
4. ✅ `.github/workflows/staging-deployment.yml` - DELETED

## Deployment Strategy

**Single Source of Truth: Famous**

- All builds and deployments are now triggered exclusively through Famous
- No duplicate CI/CD pipelines
- No conflicting deployments
- Cleaner GitHub Actions history

## Remaining GitHub Actions

The following workflows are **RETAINED** for environment management:

- `.github/workflows/automated-env-sync.yml` - Environment variable synchronization
- `.github/workflows/env-sync-deployment.yml` - Environment deployment sync
- `.github/workflows/env-validation-status.yml` - Environment validation status checks
- `.github/workflows/env-validation.yml` - Environment validation

These workflows support configuration management and do not conflict with Famous deployments.

## Deployment Workflow

```
Famous Build → dist/ → GitHub main → GitHub Pages
```

**No Vercel. No duplicate pipelines. Clean and simple.**

## Next Steps

1. Configure environment variables in Famous (Settings → Environment Variables)
2. Run build in Famous (Build → Publish to GitHub)
3. Verify deployment at https://greenscapelux.com

---

**Status:** ✅ Vercel detachment complete. Famous is now the sole deployment platform.
