# GreenScape Lux Login Loop Fix Implementation Report

## Problem Identified

The login loop was caused by a **chicken-and-egg problem** with RLS policies on the `public.users` table:

1. **AuthContext** queries `public.users` by email to get user role
2. **RLS Policy** requires `auth.uid() = id` to access users table
3. **During Authentication**: User ID is available but role lookup by email is blocked
4. **Result**: Role never resolves, user stays in loading state, login loop occurs

## Root Cause Analysis

### Original RLS Policy (PROBLEMATIC)
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" ON public.users
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

**Issue**: AuthContext queries by email (`eq('email', user.email)`) but policy only allows access by ID match.

### Authentication Flow Breakdown
1. ‚úÖ User logs in with Supabase Auth ‚Üí Session created
2. ‚ùå AuthContext tries to query `public.users` by email ‚Üí **RLS BLOCKS**
3. ‚ùå Role remains null ‚Üí User stuck in loading state
4. üîÑ Redirect logic fails ‚Üí **LOGIN LOOP**

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed RLS Policies (`supabase/migrations/9999_fix_users_rls_for_auth_lookup.sql`)

**New Policies Added:**
```sql
-- Allow email-based role lookup during authentication
CREATE POLICY "Allow email-based role lookup during auth" ON public.users
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND 
    email = auth.email()
  );

-- Allow service role to query users (for edge functions)
CREATE POLICY "Service role can query users for auth" ON public.users
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- Allow user creation during signup
CREATE POLICY "Allow user creation during signup" ON public.users
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
```

### 2. Service Role Client (`src/lib/supabaseServiceRole.ts`)

**Purpose**: Bypass RLS policies for authentication operations

**Key Functions:**
- `getUserRoleByEmail()` - Query role using service role (bypasses RLS)
- `ensureUserRecord()` - Create user record if missing
- Service role client configuration

### 3. Updated AuthContext (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**
- Import service role functions
- Use `getUserRoleByEmail()` instead of direct Supabase query
- Call `ensureUserRecord()` to ensure user exists in public.users
- Add fallback to 'client' role to prevent login loops
- Enhanced error handling and logging

**New Flow:**
1. ‚úÖ User logs in ‚Üí Session created
2. ‚úÖ `ensureUserRecord()` ‚Üí Creates user record if missing
3. ‚úÖ `getUserRoleByEmail()` ‚Üí Queries role using service role (bypasses RLS)
4. ‚úÖ Role resolved ‚Üí User redirected to appropriate dashboard

## Files Modified

1. **`supabase/migrations/9999_fix_users_rls_for_auth_lookup.sql`** - New RLS policies
2. **`src/lib/supabaseServiceRole.ts`** - Service role client (NEW FILE)
3. **`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`** - Updated role resolution logic

## Testing Requirements

### Before Deployment
1. **Apply Migration**: Run the new migration on Supabase
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is configured
3. **Test Login Flow**: 
   - Client login ‚Üí Should redirect to `/client-dashboard`
   - Landscaper login ‚Üí Should redirect to `/landscaper-dashboard`
   - Admin login ‚Üí Should redirect to `/admin-dashboard`

### Verification Steps
```bash
# 1. Check RLS policies are applied
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'users';

# 2. Test service role access
# Should return user role without RLS blocking
SELECT role FROM public.users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

## Fallback Safety Measures

1. **Role Fallback**: If role resolution fails, defaults to 'client' to prevent loops
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with logging
3. **User Record Creation**: Automatically creates missing user records
4. **Multiple Policy Paths**: Both email-based and service role policies for redundancy

## Expected Outcome

- ‚úÖ **Login loops eliminated** - Users will successfully authenticate and redirect
- ‚úÖ **Role resolution works** - Service role bypasses RLS restrictions  
- ‚úÖ **Backward compatibility** - Existing users continue to work
- ‚úÖ **Security maintained** - RLS policies still protect user data appropriately
- ‚úÖ **Fallback protection** - System degrades gracefully if issues occur

## Next Steps

1. Deploy migration to production Supabase instance
2. Configure `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in environment variables
3. Test login flow for all user types (client, landscaper, admin)
4. Monitor logs for any remaining authentication issues
5. Remove temporary admin overrides once confirmed working
