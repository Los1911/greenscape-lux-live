# Stripe Connect Account Webhook Sync - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Implemented real-time webhook synchronization for Stripe Connect account status updates, ensuring landscaper dashboards always display current payment account state.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### Landscapers Table - New Columns
```sql
- stripe_charges_enabled: BOOLEAN (Can accept charges)
- stripe_payouts_enabled: BOOLEAN (Can receive payouts)
- stripe_details_submitted: BOOLEAN (Identity verified)
- stripe_account_status: TEXT (not_started, pending, active, restricted)
```

#### Approval Logs Table - Enhanced Tracking
```sql
- stripe_connect_id: TEXT
- webhook_event_id: TEXT
- charges_enabled: BOOLEAN
- payouts_enabled: BOOLEAN
- details_submitted: BOOLEAN
- previous_status: JSONB
- new_status: JSONB
- metadata: JSONB
```

### 2. Webhook Handler (`stripe-webhook`)

#### Event: `account.updated`
Automatically syncs when Stripe updates Connect account status:

**Triggers:**
- Landscaper completes identity verification
- Banking information added/verified
- Stripe enables charges capability
- Stripe enables payouts capability
- Account restrictions applied/removed

**Actions:**
1. Fetches current landscaper status
2. Updates landscapers table with new status
3. Logs change to approval_logs for audit trail
4. Triggers real-time UI update via Supabase subscriptions

**Status Logic:**
- `active`: charges_enabled AND payouts_enabled = true
- `pending`: details_submitted = true, waiting for approval
- `not_started`: no details submitted yet

### 3. Real-Time Dashboard Updates

#### ConnectAccountStatus Component
**Features:**
- Real-time subscription to landscapers table changes
- Automatic UI refresh when webhook updates database
- Manual refresh button for immediate status check
- Clear status indicators with descriptions
- Direct link to Stripe Express Dashboard

**Status Display:**
- ✅ **Active**: Green badge, all capabilities enabled
- ⏳ **Under Review**: Yellow badge, details submitted
- ⚠️ **Setup Required**: Gray badge, incomplete onboarding

### 4. Webhook Configuration

#### Required Stripe Webhook Events
```
account.updated
payment_intent.succeeded
payment_intent.payment_failed
customer.subscription.created
customer.subscription.updated

#### Webhook Endpoint

#### Environment Variables Required
