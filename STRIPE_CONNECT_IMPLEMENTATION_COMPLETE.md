# Stripe Connect Implementation Complete

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added `stripe_connect_id` column to landscapers table
- Added `connect_account_status` tracking field
- Added boolean flags for `connect_charges_enabled`, `connect_payouts_enabled`, `connect_details_submitted`
- Created indexes for faster lookups

### 2. Edge Function: create-stripe-connect-account
- Creates Stripe Express Connect accounts for landscapers
- Generates Account Links for onboarding flow
- Handles redirect URLs for success/refresh scenarios
- Stores Connect account ID in database

### 3. Frontend Components

#### StripeConnectOnboarding.tsx
- Button to initiate Stripe Connect onboarding
- Calls edge function to create Express account
- Redirects to Stripe-hosted onboarding flow
- Handles loading and error states

#### ConnectAccountStatus.tsx
- Displays current Connect account status
- Shows charges enabled, payouts enabled, details submitted
- Provides link to Stripe Express Dashboard
- Real-time status badges

### 4. Integration Points

#### LandscaperOnboarding.tsx
- Integrated StripeConnectOnboarding component
- Detects if Connect account already exists
- Handles return from Stripe onboarding (success/refresh)
- Shows success message and auto-redirects to dashboard

#### ProfilePanel.tsx
- Added ConnectAccountStatus component
- Displays payment account status in profile
- Allows landscapers to manage their Connect account

## How It Works

1. **Landscaper signs up** → Profile created in database
2. **During onboarding** → StripeConnectOnboarding button appears
3. **Click "Connect Bank Account"** → Edge function creates Express account
4. **Redirect to Stripe** → Landscaper completes identity verification and banking setup
5. **Return to app** → Success message shown, stripe_connect_id saved
6. **Dashboard** → ConnectAccountStatus shows account is active and ready for payouts

## Environment Variables Required

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Already configured in Supabase Vault
- Production domain: `https://www.greenscapelux.com` (hardcoded in edge function)

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Webhook Handler**: Create webhook to listen for `account.updated` events to sync Connect account status
2. **Payout Processing**: Implement automatic payouts when jobs are completed
3. **Testing**: Test full flow with Stripe test mode accounts
4. **Monitoring**: Add logging for Connect account creation and status changes
